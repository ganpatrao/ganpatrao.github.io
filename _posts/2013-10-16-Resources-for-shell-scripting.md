I have been learning shell scripting lately, because it was very useful to me in my Degree Project in automation of the tasks.
It really unleashes the possibilities you can have in linux. It is not that hard, and can be learnt over a weekend. 

I am using some resources to learn and practice it. 

First of all, I saw all the videos in this [youtube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL18DF64CBBAEAAE77). This guy explains everything in a really simple and easy to understand manner, and has exercizes in each chapter. I found this the best way to start learning shell scripting.

Then, there are some websites like [Bash hackers wiki](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/doku.php) which have basics of shell scripting in a wiki form.


Finally, to keep refreshing on the concepts, there are subreddits like -

[r/shell](http://www.reddit.com/r/shell/)

[r/commandline](http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/)

[r/scriptswap](http://www.reddit.com/r/ScriptSwap)
