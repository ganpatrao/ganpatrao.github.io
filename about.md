I am a Civil Engineering and Fluid Mechanics student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I enjoy music, writing, debating and researching interesting stuff. 

As part of my dual degree project, I am currently studying modelling of heterogenous porous media flow using FEHM code which was developed by Los Almos National Lab.
